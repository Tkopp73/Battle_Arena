# Battle_Arena
A multiplayer game that uses express and socket.io on the backend and React router on the front end.  The first person creates the game and then shares their room id with their friends, who are able to enter it in along with their names and start the game.

## Installation

Make sure that you have installed the dependencies for both the client and the server side.  Then you should be able to open up a terminal window for each and run npm start for both of them.
